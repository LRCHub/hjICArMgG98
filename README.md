[00:09.13] Feel the funk blast
[00:12.57] Feel the funk blast
[00:15.57] Feel the funk blast
[00:18.50] Feel the funk blast
[00:20.13] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
[00:31.13] 
[00:24.58] I be walkin' god like a dog
[00:27.19] My narrative fearless
[00:28.76] My word war returns to burn
[00:30.34] Like Baldwin home from Paris
[00:31.74] Like Steel from a furnace
[00:33.14] I was born landless
[00:34.67] This is tha native son
[00:36.25] Born of Zapata's guns
[00:37.99] Stroll through tha shanties
[00:38.68] And tha cities remains
[00:40.44] Same bodies buried hungry
[00:42.06] But with different last names
[00:43.60] These vultures rob everything
[00:45.28] Leave nothing but chains
[00:46.68] Pick a point on tha globe
[00:48.02] Yes tha pictures tha same
[00:49.58] There's a bank There's a church a myth and a hearse
[00:52.51] A mall and a loan a child dead at birth
[00:55.56] There's a widow pig parrot
[00:57.44] A rebel to tame
[00:58.76] A whitehooded judge
[01:00.18] A syringe and a vein
[01:10.18] 
[01:04.88] And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard
[01:14.34] What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?
[01:25.77] What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?
[01:31.47] I'm calm like a bomb
[01:37.38] I'm calm like a bomb
[01:47.38] 
[01:44.04] This ain't subliminal
[01:45.54] Feel tha critical mass approach horizon
[01:47.59] Tha pulse of tha condemned
[01:48.86] Sound off America's demise
[01:50.53] Tha anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
[01:52.68] Yes I spit fire
[01:53.53] Hope lies in tha smoldering rubble of empires
[01:56.67] Yes back through tha shanties and tha cities remains
[01:59.61] Tha same bodies buried hungry
[02:01.57] But with different last names
[02:03.03] These vultures rob everyone
[02:04.56] Leave nothing but chains
[02:06.16] Pick a point here at home
[02:07.41] Yes tha picture's tha same
[02:09.19] There's a field full of slaves
[02:11.03] Some corn and some debt
[02:12.32] There's a ditch full of bodies
[02:13.88] Tha check for tha rent
[02:15.43] There's a tap, tha phone, tha silence of stone
[02:18.44] The numb black screen
[02:19.85] That be feelin' like home
[02:32.35] 
[02:24.14] And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard
[02:28.49] What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?
[02:34.09] What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?
[02:40.59] What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?
[02:54.36] I'm calm like a bomb
[03:04.36] 
[03:03.06] Calm like a bomb
[03:09.54] I'm calm like a bomb
[03:19.54] 
[03:52.25] I'm calm like a bomb
[03:58.44] I'm calm like a bomb
[04:04.42] I'm calm like a bomb
[04:10.57] I'm calm like a bomb
[04:20.57] 
[04:16.79] There's a mass without roofs
[04:18.91] A prison to fill
[04:20.85] A country's soul that reads post no bills
[04:23.51] A strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill
[04:26.47] A right to obey
[04:27.97] And a right to kill
[04:29.57] A mass without roofs
[04:30.98] A prison to fill
[04:32.54] A country's soul that reads post no bills
[04:35.70] A strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill
[04:38.53] A right to obey
[04:40.21] And a right to kill
